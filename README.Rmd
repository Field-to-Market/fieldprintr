The goal of fieldprintr is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of fieldprintr like so:

``` r
pak::pkg_install("Field-to-Market/fieldprintr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to ...

```{r example}
library(fieldprintr)

candyland <- read_ftm_cd(
    "data-raw/12-09-2022-1234_Comprehensive_Data_Candyland_Farms.xlsx")

head(candyland)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
